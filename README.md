# CMT309_Computational-Data-Science
 CourseWork 1:
 We were given with three Python codes, named testQ1.py, testQ2.py and testQ3.py. These codes will give you the chance to test your implementations of the questions. Each code runs your implementations for a number of testcases. You use the test codes to make sure that function does not crash, that is, there is no Python errors when trying to run the function.Compare the results of the testcases to your results. Expected results are given at the end of each code.
For Q1 and Q3, returning the same outputs in the test codes does not assure that we will get full marks. We will use additional testcases (not disclosed) to test your functions. For Q2, all the testcases are shown in the question. How to use the test codes:
• Create your functions in any environment.
• In each code, replace pass command with your implementation of each required function.
• Execute the updated test file. It will run your implementations for a number of testcases specified in the questions. If any errors occur, you need to correct your code.
IMPORTANT: You must make sure that your file executes and does not crash before submitting to Learning Central. Any function that crashes or does not execute will
receive 0 marks on the respective (sub)question.
